BinarySearchTrees are formed in such a manner that
    for any node in the tree
    all the nodes to its left part are <root in some cases =root
    all the nodes to its right part are >root

    Introduction to BinarySearchTrees:

    Search in a Binary Search Tree:
        Search for a node
    Find Min/Max in BST:
        for min : left most node
