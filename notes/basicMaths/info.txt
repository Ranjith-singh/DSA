use % operator to get last digit
reverse a number:
    raise the number by 1 decimal point
    add the new number
print all Divisors:
    traverse till sqrt(n)
check for prime:
    check for divisors b/w 2 and n-1
    std isPrime func
    multiple primes:
        keep a boolean array
        check if a number is prime using boolean array value is true
        check till sqrt of N
        if number is prime:
            mark all its multiples as false
gcd of 2 number:
    find greatest divisors and return
    gcd(a,b): a is greater than b
        recursively call gcd(b,a%b) until b=0
