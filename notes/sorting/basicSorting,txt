Selection sort:
    traverse the array and find the min/max
    swap it with the min/max index in the array range
    reduce the range by 1
    do it till range<=1
Bubble sort:
    swap the elements based on the max b/w elements until we put max element in max index place
    reduce the range of max index to max-1
insertion sort:
    divide the array into 2 parts sorted and unsorted resp
    grab the 1st element in the unsorted and figure out its place in the sorted array
        until then move increment elements index by 1
    Once figured out break out of loop and place the element
