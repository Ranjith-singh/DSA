frequencies of elements in an array:
    use hashMap or perform directly using list
Maximum frequency of a elements with additional k incremental ops:
    sort the array cause it groups all elements in increasing order
    traverse the array backwards cause we can perform only incremental ops not decremental
    use 2 pointer approach
    keeping j as const move the i to left until gap>k:
        indicating that the gap in numbers can be filled by k until gap<=k
    while gap>k:
        gap = gap - (arr[j]-arr[j-1])*(j-i); j--;
            moves towards the left until their is a element changes and gap b/w the changed element index and i are calculated
    keep the max freq count and if required the element also.
