hashing:
    storing the values for input keys
arrayBased hashing:
    for numbers:
        if input size is less than the max array size possible
        use array for storing the values of input keys
    for characters:
        here the input size is fixed unlike in case of numbers
hashMap and HashSet:
    it uses division method, mid sq method etc to store the values for keys above 10^7
    ordered Map:
        tc: logN->N is number of keys stored in hash
    unordered Map:
        best and average tc: 1
        worst case tc: N
