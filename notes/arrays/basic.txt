the maximum size of the array can be 10^6 in local and 10^7 in global
when only declaring a array :
    local takes garbage value
    global takes 0
rules:
    use 2 pointer approach
    keep count
    use hashing
    xor
    sorted: binarySearch
problems :
    find largest
    find second largest :
        in second if add element>second and element<largest condition
    find if sorted
    remove duplicate in sorted array no extra space:
        use 2 pointer approach
        return last element next index
    left rotate by 1 position
    left rotate by d positions :
        better approach :
            use temp array of size d
        optimal approach :
            reverse array
    move zeros to end :
        2 pointer approach
    linear search
    union of 2 arrays :
        2 pointer approach
    intersection of arrays :
        2 pointer approach
    Max consecutive one :
        use previous element to find consecutive
    Find missing number in an array :
        better approach :
            hashing
        optimal approach :
            use xor or sum
    Find the number that appears once, and other numbers twice :
        better approach :
            hashing
        optimal approach :
            use xor
    Longest subarray with given sum K(positives) :
        better approach :
            hashing : use reverse engineering: instead of finding k find sum-k while traversing the array
        optimal approach :
            2 pointer approach
    Longest subarray with sum K (Positives + Negatives) :
        hashing : use reverse engineering
