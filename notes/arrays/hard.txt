Pascal's Triangle :
    value at ith row and jth col :
        use the combinations nCr formula and reduce the equation
    add the 1 at 0 index because on logic constraints
    entire ith row :
        nCr formula where n is constant r changes
        add just r and (n-r)th element in the previous equation/element to denominator and numerator resp to get the value
majority element(n/3) :
    use 2 counter and 2 elements and compare with other elements but not with each other
    note:
        use cases that check primarily for the firstMajor than for secondMajor
3 sum problem :
    better approach :
        use hashing
    optimal approach :
        sort the array
        use 3 pointer approach
4 sum problem :
    better approach :
        use hashing
    optimal approach :
        sort the array
        use 3 pointer approach
Count number of subarrays with given xor K :
    use hashing
Merge overlapping sub-intervals :
    override the original sort while returning
Merge two sorted arrays without extra space :
    2 pointer approach
    shell sort's :
        gap approach
missing and duplicate in an array :
    better approach :
        use hashing
    optimal approach :
        use Maths(sum and sq sum)
        use xor
Count Inversions :
    (a[i]>a[j] where i<j)
    Merge sort technique with count variable
Reverse Pairs :
    (a[i]>2*a[j] where i<j)
    Merge sort technique with count variable
Maximum Product Subarray :
    prefix and suffix sum approach
