types of trees:
    Full BinaryTree:
        children should be 0 or 2
    complete BinaryTree:
        all levels are filled except last level
        last level filling should be from left
    perfect BinaryTree:
        Full BinaryTree + complete BinaryTree
        internal nodes should have 2 children and left nodes should have same depth
    Balanced BinaryTree:
        height diff b/w the left and right subTree of any node should be atmost 1
    Degenerate BinaryTree:
        each node has only 1 child similar to linked list
